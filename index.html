	<span itemprop="title">PhD candidate</span> in <span itemprop="title"> Political Science 
	</span> at <span itemprop="affiliation">University of São Paulo</span>.</p>
	
	<p> I received a <span itemprop="title">B.A.</span> in Social Sciences and <span itemprop="title">M.A.</span> in 
	Political Science from the University of São Paulo. I analysed the decision-making process on the Brazilian system of 
	government carried out by the Constituent Assembly of 1987-88. Currently, my main research topic is the Brazilian 
	Supreme Court, especially the justices' behaviour. I have also written working papers on research methods, political 
	parties and democratic theory.
	
	<p> My research interests are: judicial politics, institutional design, 
	political institutions, comparative politics and Brazilian politics.</p>
